    Note that delete-orphan will remove branch if it was removed from section and the section was saved. This is okay
    since branch can't exist without section, but in order to move branch between two sections you'll need to use hacks
    because when you remove branch from one section, it will be removed and Hibernate won't allow you to save the 2nd
    section with this branch because the branch was already removed. In order to overcome this issue you need to
    save branch to the second section first, afterwards flush() and evict() it from session and then save the second
    section you're removing branch from.
