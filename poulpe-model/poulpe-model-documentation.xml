    <title>Structure</title>
    <para>There are several key items in the structure of the Model:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>JTalks Common - since JTalks is a multi-component project with components having in a lot of cases the
          same entities and validation rules, a lot of our entities are placed in a separate project and are exposed as
          already ready-to use JAR files in
          <link xl:href="http://repo.jtalks.org/content/groups/public/org/jtalks/common">our Maven Repo</link>.
          We use those JARs to create a schema in our database (jtalks-common-model
          contains migration scripts), to map the entities per se to the database (the Hibernate mapping for all the
          entities is inside Poulpe), to use some commonly used classes e.g. for Security.
          <para>If we want to add something to common modules, we need to raise a ticket in JIRA for JTalks Common
            project
            and it will be resolved by common team and exposed as next version of common artifacts.
