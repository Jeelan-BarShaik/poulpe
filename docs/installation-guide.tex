Here is the software you'll need:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Java \textgreater= 1.6
 \item MySQL 5.5 (even though it might be possible to work with 5.1). 
 \item Tomcat \textgreater= 6
\end{enumerate}
After everything is installed, you can download the latest war file from our Maven repository:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \href{http://repo.jtalks.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jtalks/poulpe/poulpe-web-view}{Stable versions}
 \item \href{http://repo.jtalks.org/content/repositories/deployment-pipeline/deployment-pipeline/poulpe}{In active development}
\end{itemize}
When you downloaded the war file, rename it to 'poulpe.war' and put it into the webapps directory, but before starting Tomcat, you probably would need to configure Poulpe. 

As a first step you should create a database for it: \emph{create database poulpe character set = utf8;}

Then create such a file: \emph{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/poulpe.xml}, it should look similar to \href{run:./poulpe.xml}{this sample}, just put there your connection details and pay attention to comments. Then start the Tomcat and everything should start working.
