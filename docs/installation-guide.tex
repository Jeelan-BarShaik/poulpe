Here is the software you'll need:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Java \textgreater= 1.6
 \item MySQL 5.5 (even though it might be possible to work with 5.1). 
 \item Tomcat \textgreater= 6
\end{enumerate}
After everything is installed, you can download the latest war file from our Maven repository:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \href{http://repo.jtalks.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jtalks/poulpe/poulpe-web-view}{Stable versions}
 \item \href{http://repo.jtalks.org/content/repositories/deployment-pipeline/deployment-pipeline/poulpe}{In active development}
\end{itemize}
When you downloaded the war file, rename it to 'poulpe.war' and put it into the webapps directory, but before starting Tomcat, you probably would need to configure Poulpe. 

So first create such a file: \emph{\$TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/poulpe.xml}, and it should look similar to \href{run:./poulpe.xml}{this}
